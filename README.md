Repository for personal portfolio webpage

Uses HTML and CSS to build the majority of the site's base
<br/> Uses JavaScript to implement specific functionalities and animations for a hamburger style navigation menu

Scrollable website, clickable images are linked to a separate page with a specific project
<br/> Shadows are added behind images for aesthetics, a coloured border appears when tabbing between elements
<br/> Hover effects are added to clickable elements
<br/> Navigation bar remains on screen when clicked and disappears when an element in the menu is clicked
